\title{Convert ASCED fields of education into the consistent format used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
This function enables both exact (default) and fuzzy matching.
Under exact matching, if no match is found, NA is returned.}
\usage{
clean_asced_foe(
  x,
  fuzzy_match = FALSE,
  max_dist = 0.4,
  method = "jw",
  silent = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a (character) vector containing ASCED fields of education.
Note that clean_asced_foe always returns a character vector. If no match is found, then NA is returned.}

\item{fuzzy_match}{logical; either TRUE which indicates that
approximate/fuzzy string matching should be used, or FALSE (the default) which indicates that
only exact matches should be used. If FALSE, then if no match is found, then NA is returned.}

\item{max_dist}{numeric, sets the maximum acceptable distance between your
string and the matched string. Default is 0.4. Only relevant when fuzzy_match is TRUE.}

\item{method}{the method used for approximate/fuzzy string matching. Default
is "jw", the Jaro-Winker distance; see `??stringdist-metrics` for more options.
Only relevant when fuzzy_match is TRUE.}

\item{silent}{a boolean value. If FALSE (the default), the function will warn that NAs were returned.}
}
\value{
a character vector
