#' Australian Skills Classification (ASC) Core Competencies
#'
#' As described by the National Skills Commission:
#' Core competencies are common to all jobs. They describe a set of non-specialist
#' skills gained in early life and schooling and provide a base to further
#' develop skills and specialties . Popular terms for these include ‘foundation
#' skills’, ‘common skills’, ‘soft skills’, ‘core skills’ and ‘employability
#' skills’. As part of the Australian Skills Classification work, the NSC
#' identified 10 core competencies required for every occupation in Australia.
#' The core competencies align to the definitions of foundation skills typically
#' used in the Australian VET system – specifically, the Employability Skills
#' Framework developed by the Australian Skills Quality Authority, with minor
#' differences recommended by education system experts.

#' Australian Skills Classification (ASC) Specialist Tasks
#'
#' As described by the National Skills Commission:
#' The specialist tasks are designed to describe day- to -day work within an
#' occupation, and are work activities a person undertakes specific to a job.
#' While these skills can be transferrable across occupations and sectors,
#' unlike core competencies, they are not universal. The Australian Skills
#' Classification identifies specialist tasks for occupations in the Australian
#' labour market in a way that allows these tasks to be compared across
#' different occupations.
#'
#' The skills clusters are clusters of similar specialist tasks. These tasks are
#' considered to be broadly transferable – if you can do one task in the
#' cluster, you can do the others. They show how skills are related and
#' connected to one another, and illustrates the transferability of skills
#' across occupations.

#' Australian Skills Classification (ASC) Technology Tools
#'
#' As described by the National Skills Commission:
#' Technology tools are a technology, such as software or hardware, that is used
#' within an occupation. Common technology tools, (such as search engines and
#' email,) are featured across most occupations, and these are captured in the
#' core competency of digital engagement, rather than under this section. The
#' remaining technology tools are highly specialised and occupation-specific.
