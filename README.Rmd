The `strayr` package provides tools to make working with Australian
data easier. This includes:

-   tidy versions of common structures used by the Australian Bureau of
    Statistics (ABS), like ANZSIC and ANZSCO:

-   a function to tidy up state names (`clean_states()`); and

-   a function that knows whether particular dates are public holidays
    (`is_holiday()`).

This package is currently **in development** and subject to change. The
lifecycle badge will be changed to `stable` when it is stable (should be
relatively soon).

**Contribute to this package**: people are actively encouraged to
contribute to this package.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `strayr` with:

```

# rather than installed version

```
