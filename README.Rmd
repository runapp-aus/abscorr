The `strayr` package provides tools to make working with Australian
data easier. This includes:

-   tidy versions of common structures used by the Australian Bureau of
    Statistics (ABS), like ANZSIC and ANZSCO:

-   a function to tidy up state names (`clean_states()`); and

-   a function that knows whether particular dates are public holidays
    (`is_holiday()`).

This package is currently **in development** and subject to change. The
lifecycle badge will be changed to `stable` when it is stable (should be
relatively soon).

**Contribute to this package**: people are actively encouraged to
contribute to this package.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `strayr` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("runapp-aus/strayr")
```

## Structures

Current structures stored in `strayr` are:

-   `anzsco`: occupation levels of the [Australian and New Zealand
    Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO), First Edition,
    Revision 1, 2009. Cat.
    1220.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1220.0First%20Edition,%20Revision%201?OpenDocument).
-   `anzsic`: industry levels of the [Australian and New Zealand
    Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC), 2006 (Revision 1.0).
    Cat.
    1292.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/20C5B5A4F46DF95BCA25711F00146D75?opendocument).
-   `asced_foe`: field of education levels of the [Australian Standard
    Classification of Education (ASCED), 2001. Cat.
    1272.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1272.0).
-   `asced_qual`: qualification levels of the [Australian Standard
    Classification of Education (ASCED), 2001. Cat.
    1272.0](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1272.0).

The `strayr` package also loads
[`absmapsdata`](https://github.com/wfmackey/absmapsdata), which contains
the following structures *and their geometry* as `sf` objects:

**ASGS Main Structures**

-   `sa12011`: Statistical Area 1 2011
-   `sa12016`: Statistical Area 1 2016
-   `sa22011`: Statistical Area 2 2011
-   `sa22016`: Statistical Area 2 2016
-   `sa32011`: Statistical Area 3 2011
-   `sa32016`: Statistical Area 3 2016
-   `sa42011`: Statistical Area 4 2011
-   `sa42016`: Statistical Area 4 2016
-   `gcc2011`: Greater Capital Cities 2011
-   `gcc2016`: Greater Capital Cities 2016
-   `ra2011`: Remoteness Areas 2011
-   `ra2016`: Remoteness Areas 2016
-   `state2011`: State 2011
-   `state2016`: State 2016

**ASGS Non-ABS Structures**

-   `ced2018`: Commonwealth Electoral Divisions 2018
-   `sed2018`: State Electoral Divisions 2018
-   `lga2016`: Local Government Areas 2016
-   `lga2018`: Local Government Areas 2018
-   `regional_ivi2008`: Regions for the Internet Vacancy Index 2008
-   `postcodes2016`: Postcodes 2016
-   `dz2011`: Census of Population and Housing Destination Zones 2011
-   `dz2016`: Census of Population and Housing Destination Zones 2016

## Using ABS structures

Loading the package will lazily load the structures listed above. Call
them with their name:

```{r actual-load, include=FALSE}
# use this to make sure README runs with current build
# rather than installed version
devtools::load_all()
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

```{r fake-load, eval=FALSE}
library(strayr)
#> Loading required package: absmapsdata
library(dplyr)
```

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(anzsco)
glimpse(anzsic)
glimpse(asced_foe)
glimpse(asced_qual)
glimpse(sa42016)
glimpse(ced2018)
```

## Converting state names and abbreviations

The `clean_state()` function makes it easy to wrangle vectors of State names and abbreviations - which might be in different forms and possibly
misspelled.

Let's start with a character vector that includes some misspelled State names,
some correctly spelled state names, as well as some abbreviations both malformed
and correctly formed.

```{r create-string}

x <- c("western Straya", "w. A ", "new soth wailes", "SA", "tazz", "Victoria",
       "northn territy")

```

To convert this character vector to a vector of abbreviations for State names,
 use `clean_state()`:

```{r state}
clean_state(x)

```

If you want full names for the states rather than abbreviations:

```{r state-fullnames}

clean_state(x, to = "state_name")

```

By default, `clean_state()` uses fuzzy or approximate string matching to match the 
elements in your character vector to state names/abbreviations. If you only want
to permit exact matching, you can disable fuzzy matching. This means you will 
never get false matches, but you will also fail to match misspelled state names 
or malformed abbreviations; you'll get an `NA` if no match can be found.

```{r state-exact}
 clean_state(x, fuzzy_match = FALSE)

```

If your data is in a data frame, `clean_state()` works well within a `dplyr::mutate()` call:

```{r dplyr}

 x_df <- data.frame(state = x, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

library(dplyr)
 x_df %>% 
   mutate(state_abbr = clean_state(state))
```

## Australian public holidays
This package includes the `auholidays` dataset from the [Australian Public Holidays Dates Machine Readable Dataset](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/australian-holidays-machine-readable-dataset) as well as a helper function `is_holiday`:

```{r is_holiday_example}
str(auholidays)


is_holiday('2020-01-01')
is_holiday('2019-05-27', jurisdictions = c('ACT', 'TAS'))

h_df <- data.frame(dates = c('2020-01-01', '2020-01-10'))

h_df %>%
  mutate(IsHoliday = is_holiday(dates))
```
